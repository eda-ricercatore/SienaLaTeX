\section{Writing \LaTeX\ Symbols}
\label{sec:WritingLaTeXSymbols}


Symbols used to represent \LaTeX\ and related computer languages/technologies and concepts are: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item \LaTeX
\item \LaTeXe
\item {\sc Bib}\TeX\ (or B{\scriptsize IB}\TeX)
\item \AmS-\LaTeX
\item \MP
\item \MF
\item \texttrademark
\item \textregistered
\item To use the registered symbol as a superscript, avoid doing this in the math mode or in mathematical environments, since this will cause the registered symbol not to typeset properly. The following sequence of {\tt $\backslash$textsuperscript}{\tt $\backslash$textregistered} \LaTeX\ commands should be used instead, such as: {\it quectoSAT}\textsuperscript\textregistered\ solver. \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item Use a backslash after it, just like the following symbols that can cause naturally occuring character space to disappear: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item \textsuperscript\textregistered\ needs space\dots Compared with \textsuperscript\textregistered\ needs space. \vspace{-0.1cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -1pt
			\item nanoPlace II\textsuperscript\textregistered is far superior compared with picoPlace VI\textsuperscript\textregistered for detailed placement (without spacing).
			\item nanoPlace II\textsuperscript\textregistered\ is far superior compared with picoPlace VI\textsuperscript\textregistered\ for detailed placement (with spacing).
			\item When in doubt if a space is need, since this example does not indicate a need, use a character space anyway. It does not change the spacing by much.
			\end{enumerate}
		\item \LaTeX\ needs space\dots Compared with \LaTeX needs space.
		\item \LaTeXe\ needs space\dots Compared with \LaTeXe needs space.
		\item {\sc Bib}\TeX\ needs space\dots Compared with {\sc Bib}\TeX needs space.
		\item B{\scriptsize IB}\TeX\ needs space\dots Compared with B{\scriptsize IB}\TeX needs space.
		\item \MF\ needs space\dots Compared with \MF needs space.
		\item \MP\ needs space\dots Compared with \MP needs space.
		\item \texttrademark\ needs space\dots Compared with \texttrademark needs space.
		\item \textregistered\ needs space\dots Compared with \textregistered needs space.
		\item \copyright\ needs space\dots Compared with \copyright needs space.
		\item \textcopyleft\ needs space\dots Compared with \textcopyleft needs space.
		\item \AmS-\LaTeX\ needs space\dots Compared with \AmS-\LaTeX needs space.
		\item \officialeuro\ needs space\dots Compared with \officialeuro needs space.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}
\item \copyright
\item \textcopyleft
\end{enumerate}





Other symbols of interests: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item \officialeuro
\item ``$\backslash >$'': 
\item 
\end{enumerate}
