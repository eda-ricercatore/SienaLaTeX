\chapter{Figures}
\label{chp:Figures}

A template for inserting figures is shown in Figures \ref{fig:MyFigure1}, \ref{fig:MyFigure2}, \ref{fig:MyFigure3}, and \ref{fig:MyFigure4}. \\

I have used the {\tt $\backslash$clearpage} command to clear the remanding part of the first page for this section (\S\ref{chp:Figures}), and insert the remaining figures and text in subsequent pages. If the last three figures (Figures  \ref{fig:MyFigure3} and \ref{fig:MyFigure4}) are reordered to the following order, Figures \ref{fig:MyFigure4} and \ref{fig:MyFigure3}, the effects of the {\tt $\backslash$clearpage} command would be more evident.


\begin{figure}[h]
\centering 
\includegraphics[height=1.5in]{./pics/short}
\caption{Caption for my figure1}
\label{fig:MyFigure1}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering 
\includegraphics[height=1.5in]{./pics/small}
\caption{Caption for my figure2}
\label{fig:MyFigure2}
\end{figure}

%	Clear the remanding part of the page, and insert the remaining figures and text in subsequent pages.
\clearpage

\begin{figure}[h]
