#	SienaLaTeX


A repository for my *LaTeX* templates.

This contains templates for *LaTeX* documents that I tend to create, *LaTeX* structures that I tend to use (such as tables, lists, and figures), and *LaTeX* commands.



This repository is organized as follows:  
1)	Documents for this projects that are in the text file format. E.g., [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/eda-globetrotter/SienaLaTeX/blob/master/LICENSE.md) and [README.md.](https://github.com/eda-globetrotter/SienaLaTeX/blob/master/README.md)  
2)	articoli: A *LaTeX* template for articles.  
3)	curriculum_vitae: A *LaTeX* template for curriculum vitaes and resumes.  
4)	presentazione: A *LaTeX* template for creating presentation slides.  
5)	rapporto: A *LaTeX* template for reports.  
6)	scripts: A *Ruby* script to remove temporary files, and *Python* scripts to
		manage *BibTeX* databases.  

For each subdirectory, a *Makefile* is provided to typeset the document with *LaTeX* (and add references, if necessary).

Use the *Makefile* to typeset the *LaTeX* document.

To do that, try the following on the command line of a *UNIX*-like operating system: make latex

If the *LaTeX* typesetting system is not installed on your computer, you can download it for free from either of the following:
* [LaTeX -- A document preparation system](http://www.latex-project.org/)
* [TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive/)
* [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/)
* [TeX Users Group (TUG)](http://tug.org/)
* [Com足pre足hen足sive TeX Archive Net足work (CTAN)](http://www.ctan.org/)


##	*LaTeX* Notes

[Zhiyang Ong's *LaTeX* Notes](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/SienaLaTeX/blob/master/notes/latex.md)

###	Additional Comments

In *Markdown*, you can use *LaTeX* to typeset mathematical equations, such as Maxwell-Faraday equation (Faraday's law of induction): $$\mathbf{\oint_{\partial\sum}\ E \cdot} d\mathbf{l} = -\frac{d}{dt} \iint_{\sum} \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{S}$$

For *GitHub* users, they can use the *GitHub* App
	[TeXify](https://github.com/apps/texify) to transform *LaTeX* expressions
	in **\*.tex.md** files, and render their *LaTeX* expressions as embedded
	SVG images in the transformed *Markdown* documents.
This requires write access to (a specified subset of) your repositories,
	so that it can update your repositories with the transformed
	*Markdown* documents and SVG files.
It also takes a short delay to transform *Markdown* documents, and write the
	updates to your repositories.
The SVG picture files are located in the *tex* subdirectory of your
	repositories.
