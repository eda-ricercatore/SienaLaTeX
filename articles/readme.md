#	Difference Between the Normal Articles Template and Clean Articles Template


The normal article template uses LaTeX packages that have been installed in the computer system, where the LaTeX packages are installed with the installation of the LaTeX distribution (including the LaTeX typesetting interpreter/engine).

For each installation of a LaTeX distribution, the packages are located with the installed LaTeX distribution.

For users with access to multiple installations of LaTeX distributions, they have to decide which distribution and its version to use, and locate the chosen installation so that the chosen LaTeX typesetting interpreter can find the imported/included LaTeX packages.

The clean article template assumes a smaller/minimum/older installation of a LaTeX distribution that do not have certain LaTeX packages. Hence, I have included these LaTeX packages in a subdirectory `others/packages/` that allows users to use the imported/included packages. LaTeX packages that cannot be imported/included, since their source code cannot be found, have to be commented out and excluded from the preamble of the LaTeX template/document.
