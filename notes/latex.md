#	Notes About *LaTeX*


This is my notes about *LaTeX*.



##	Typesetting Issues

When I include a *BibTeX* database/file for using *BibTeX* with *LaTeX*, I can
	either use absolute/full paths or relative paths;
	that said, I am not allowed to use the shortcut to redirect a path from my
		home directory.





###	In-Text Citations

For in-text citations, use:
+ **\cite{BibTeXkey}** for citing BibTeX entries in my BibTeX database.
+ **\ref{LABEL}** to cross-reference \cite[\S11.2.1-\S11.2.2, pp. 211-212]{Kopka2004} a section, subsection, subsubsection, figure, table, or equation that is labeled with **\label{LABEL}**.






### Common Colors and Fonts that I Use

Colors and fonts that I use.
+ red
+ blue
+ magenta
+ bold (font)
+ cyan





###	Common Terms/Symbols that I Get Confused About 



+ DPLL: Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland procedure
+ rules of inference
+ rules of deduction
+ stochastic local search



Table of common symbols

| Symbol Name | Symbol  |
|-------------|---------|
| entails	  | \models |
| infers/proves/concludes | \vdash |
| implies	  | \Rightarrow, or \Longrightarrow |
| conjunction | \land or \bigwedge |
| disjunction | \lor or \bigvee |




Examples:
+ p \rightarrow q : 

A\lor B is true if {\displaystyle A}A is true, or if {\displaystyle B}B is true, or if both {\displaystyle A}A and {\displaystyle B}B are true.
A\land B 









## BibTeX Notes






#	References

Citations/References that use the *LaTeX/BibTeX* notation are taken
	from my *BibTeX* database (set of *BibTeX* entries).


If these citations/references are not found in this list of references,
	information about them can be found in my BibTeX database.
+ BLAH...




##	Resources/References on the World Wide Web

Web pages for help in *LaTeX*:
+ Templates for optimization, or mathematical programming
	- [LaTeX Templates for Optimization Models](http://www.orcomplete.com/computer/sertalpbilal/latex-templates-for-optimization-models)
	- \cite{Cay2013}
	- [My implementation](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/SienaLaTeX/blob/master/notes/examples/optimization_templates.pdf)
		* [*LaTeX* source file for my implementation](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/SienaLaTeX/blob/master/notes/examples/optimization_templates.tex)
	- [Suggested implementation from John Hammersley, who provided the LaTeX document](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/SienaLaTeX/blob/master/notes/examples/from-other-peeps/optimization-templates/main.tex)
		- I modified the author list to reflect this.
		- John Hammersley incorporated a suggestion from Vince Knight for typesetting mathematical optimization models in *LaTeX*.
